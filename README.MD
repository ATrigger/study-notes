============
There is a problem with whitespaces - I didn't mention sections lines merge 
into one, so when reading it with github or exporting to latex, some 
formulas are impossible to understand. Use original org-mode for convinient
reading\editing.
Any help will be appreciated. Please contact me if you find any bug there. 

TODO's:
 1. Make tex-pdf version
 2. ?
