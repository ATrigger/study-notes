# study-notes
That's repository containing notes on different courses given in NRU ITMO.
Reading `.org` files is much more simpler when using emacs + org.

Please contribute, especially if you have:
  * Found any semantic error
  * Found any typo/misspell
  * Found any extra-informal text that should be deleted (I'm sorry for that)
  * Used this repo and it helped you a lot (I'd be really grateful for any addings/fixes)
